The keygen.ts creates a new Solana keypair with yarn keygen

You need to save the keypair in the ./dev-wallet.json file.

The airdrop.ts requests a 2 SOL airdrop with yarn airdrop

The transfer.ts transfers 0.1 SOL from dev-wallet.json to the SECOND_WALLET with yarn transfer

The enroll.ts interacts with the WBA Prereq program, using my GitHub username "Halfgork" as a seed with yarn enroll
